# Pangeo for HPC

This repo includes instructions for setting up and running a Dask cluster on various HPC platforms. The goal is to help users get a notebook up and running on their HPC system, even if the system does not provide a JupyterHub interface.

This repository collects information for specific HPC systems. If yours does not appear here, please submit an issue or a pull request!
